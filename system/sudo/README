sudo (give limited root privileges to certain users - with PAM)

'sudo' is a command that allows users to execute some commands as
root.  The /etc/sudoers file (edited with 'visudo') specifies which
users have access to sudo and which commands they can run.  'sudo'
logs all its activities to /var/log/ so the system administrator can
keep an eye on things.
