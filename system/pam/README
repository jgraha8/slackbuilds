pam is a free implementation of the following DCE-RFC from Sunsoft.

 Q1: What exactly is PAM?
 A1: PAM = Pluggable Authentication Modules

Basically, it is a flexible mechanism for authenticating users.

Since the beginnings of UNIX, authenticating a user has been
accomplished via the user entering a password and the system checking
if the entered password corresponds to the encrypted official password
that is stored in /etc/passwd . The idea being that the user *is*
really that user if and only if they can correctly enter their secret
password.

That was in the beginning. Since then, a number of new ways of
authenticating users have become popular. Including more complicated
replacements for the /etc/passwd file, and hardware devices Smart
cards etc..

The problem is that each time a new authentication scheme is
developed, it requires all the necessary programs (login, ftpd etc...)
to be rewritten to support it.

PAM provides a way to develop programs that are independent of
authentication scheme. These programs need "authentication modules" to
be attatched to them at run-time in order to work. Which
authentication module is to be attatched is dependent upon the local
system setup and is at the discretion of the local system
administrator.
