The bmap-tools project implements bmap-related tools and API
modules. The entire project is written in python and supports python 2.7
and python 3.x.

Bmaptool is a generic tool for creating the block map (bmap) for a file
and copying files using the block map. The idea is that large files,
like raw system image files, can be copied or flashed a lot faster and
more reliably with bmaptool than with traditional tools, like "dd" or
"cp".

Some common rules for the README file:
- Maximum of 72 characters per line
- Use 2-4 spaces for indentation, avoid TAB characters
- Plain ASCII or Unicode (UTF-8) are preferred encodings.
- Do not include the homepage URL
- Additional notes before building:
  * user/group creation along with correct UID/GID
  * strict dependency build order if necessary
  * conflicts with any stock Slackware packages

If longer instructions are necessary, place them in a README.SBo file.
