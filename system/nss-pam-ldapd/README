nss-pam-ldap is a Name Service Switch (NSS) module and Pluggable
Authentication Module (PAM) that allows your LDAP server to provide
user account, group, host name, alias, netgroup, and basically any
other information that you would normally get from /etc flat files or
NIS.  It also allows you to do authentication to an LDAP server.

The pam module is disabled since pam is not officially included in
Slackware.

You must have the 'nslcd' group and user to run this script, for
example:

  groupadd -r -g 331 nslcd
  useradd -r -u 331 -d /var/run/nslcd -s /bin/false -c "User for nslcd daemon" -g nslcd nslcd
