Wine is an Open Source implementation of the Windows API on top of X
for Linux and Unix.

NOTE: This builds the stable version of wine. If you need
cutting-edge then you may want to check out wine-staging.

Options:

To build wine to run 64bit Windows executable support, use:

WIN64=yes ./wine.SlackBuild

To disable OpenGL support, use:

OPENGL=no ./wine.SlackBuild

The above options can be combined.

Optional dependencies:

fontforge:
(to build tahoma, tahomabd, and marlett fonts)

webcore-fonts:
(for tahoma, lucida console, MS fonts for the web and Win Vista)

====================================================================

NOTES

To build on x86_64 you will need to have multilib packages installed,
unless you want to build for Windows 64 bit applications only (using
WIN64=yes).

AlienBOB's multilib readme and repo:

https://docs.slackware.com/slackware:multilib
http://www.slackware.com/~alien/multilib/

I have made a script that rsyncs with alienBOB's repo and installs
the multilib packages which can be found here:

Be sure to read the short instructions at the top. If you use
slackpkg then you will also want to blacklist his packages in
/etc/slackpkg/blacklist:

[0-9]+alien
[0-9]+compat32
