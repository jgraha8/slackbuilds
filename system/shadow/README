The shadow password suite with pam support.

This set of login related programs utilizes an alternate, non-readable
file to contain the actual encrypted passwords.  This is presumed to
increase system security by increasing the difficulty with which
system crackers obtain encrypted passwords.  It was written by
Julianne Frances Haugh and the Linux port is maintained by Tomasz
Kloczko.

This package provides 'login' with pam support, which is needed to log
into the system.
