lets you securely manage your mission critical IT infrastructure.

Additional build options (each defaults to no):

   MYSQL_CLIENT=yes   Enable the MySQL connector
   LIBVIRT=yes        Enable virtual machine management support
                      (requires libvirt)

For example, to enable virtual machine management support pass
