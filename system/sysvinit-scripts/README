sysvinit-scripts (the basic scripts used to boot your machine)

These are the Slackware boot scripts, which are needed to start the
machine.  Sysvinit looks for these in /etc/rc.d/.

These scripts modify the scripts in the Slackware sysvinit-scripts
package. This package is to be used in place of the Slackware
sysvinit-scripts packages.

The changes included in this sysvinit-scripts package are:

  * Add LVM crypttab support for initializing volume groups in LUKS volumes
  * Deactivate LVM volumes before closing LUKS volumes
