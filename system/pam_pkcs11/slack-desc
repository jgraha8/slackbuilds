# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

pam_pkcs11: pam_pkcs11 (X.509 certificate based pam login module)
pam_pkcs11:
pam_pkcs11: This Linux-PAM login module allows a X.509 certificate based user
pam_pkcs11: login. The certificate and its dedicated private key are thereby
pam_pkcs11: accessed by means of an appropriate PKCS #11 module. For the
pam_pkcs11: verification of the users' certificates, locally stored CA
pam_pkcs11: certificates as well as either online or locally accessible CRLs are
pam_pkcs11: used.
