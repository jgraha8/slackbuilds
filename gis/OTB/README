ORFEO Toolbox (OTB) is an open source library of image processing algorithms.
OTB is based on the medical image processing library ITK and offers particular
functionalities for remote sensing image processing in general and for high
spatial resolution images in particular. Targeted algorithms for high
resolution optical images (Pleiades, SPOT, QuickBird, WorldView, Landsat,
Ikonos), hyperspectral sensors (Hyperion) or SAR (TerraSarX, ERS, Palsar) are
available.

Monteverdi, a satellite image viewer with access to OTB processing, will also
be built as part of this script.

OTB may use the following optional dependencies: opencv (use OPENCV=ON).
