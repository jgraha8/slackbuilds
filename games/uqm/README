uqm (port of the 3DO/PC game - Star Control II)

The Ur-Quan Masters is a port of the 3DO version of the PC game "Star
Control II". It runs on modern operating systems and is 100% free.

You may also want the optional uqm_voice, uqm_3domusic and/or
uqm_remixes packages, for a more festive gaming experience.

Optional dependencies:

SDL2 - Recommended. Although uqm still supports SDL-1.2, the
release packages for other OSes (Windows and Mac) are built using
SDL2. Autodetected, can be disabled with SDL2=no [*] in the environment.

OpenAL - Not recommended. OpenAL support in uqm is still experimental.
Not autodetected: use OPENAL=yes in the environment, to enable.

[*] In addition, for SDL-1.2 builds, OpenGL can be disabled by setting
    OPENGL=no in the environment. If you don't know why you might do
    this, you almost certainly don't need to!
