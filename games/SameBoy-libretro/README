SameBoy is an open source Game Boy (DMG) and Game Boy Color (CGB) video
game system emulator that can be used as a libretro core.

SameBoy optionally supports using the following BIOS image files for operation:

* dmg_boot.bin
* cgb_boot.bin

Open Source DMG and DGB boot roms are provided in the source tree in the
BootROMS/prebuilt directory and can be placed in RetroArch's system/bios
directory.

To build the debugging symbols use:
