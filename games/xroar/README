xroar (emulator for 6809-based systems)

XRoar is a Dragon emulator for Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, GP32, Nintendo
DS and Windows. Due to hardware similarities, XRoar also emulates the
Tandy Colour Computer (CoCo) models 1 & 2. For more information on the
Dragon and CoCo computers, see:

Optional dependencies:

SDL2 - if you prefer SDL2 to SDL1, install SDL2 before building xroar.
  I haven't noticed any difference between xroar built with SDL1 or SDL2,
  but the option is there in case you need it. If SDL2 is installed,
  you can build without it by setting SDL2=no in the environment.

gtkglext - if you want a full GTK+ user interface, install gtkglext
  before building xroar. If gtkglext is installed, you can build
  without it by setting GTKGLEXT=no in the environment.

jack - if you want to use JACK for audio output, install jack and set
  JACK=yes in the environment before building xroar. If JACK audio has
  x-runs, try 'setcap cap_ipc_lock,cap_sys_nice=ep /usr/games/xroar'.

Other build options (environment variables):

OSS - use OSS for audio? Default is "no", export OSS="yes" to enable.
      Most users won't need this.

PULSE - use PulseAudio? Default is "yes", export PULSE="no" to disable.
