qtads (a multimedia interpreter for TADS games)

QTads is a so called "interpreter" for games created with the Text
Adventure Development System, or "Tads" for short, a C-like object
oriented programming language for authoring Interactive Fiction (similar
to the Infocom or Legend Entertainment games, like "Zork"). Yes, we are
talking about text adventures here.

Both Tads 2 (*.gam) as well as Tads 3 (*.t3) games are supported. You can
find a selection of games at http://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/games/tads/

By default, Qt4 is used for the user interface. If you prefer Qt5, install
libraries/qt5 and run this script with QT5=yes in the environment.
