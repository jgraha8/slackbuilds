mtPaint is a GTK+ painting program which Mark Tyler developed from
scratch. Currently mtPaint is maintained by Dmitry Groshev. It is
aimed to be simple and easy to use. 

mtPaint can edit indexed palette or 24 bit RGB images and offers basic
painting and palette manipulation tools. It also can handle JPEG, GIF,
TIFF, BMP, XPM, and XBM files.

NOTES:
mtPaint comes with its own file and color selector widgets. To use the
GTK default ones, pass TKWIDGETS=yes to the script. If you want this
to build as a GTK1 app, pass GTK1=yes
