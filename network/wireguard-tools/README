WireGuard is a VPN that uses state-of-the-art cryptography. It is
designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces
and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances.

WireGuard userspace tools require WireGuard support in the kernel (or
as a kernel module).  Refer to the wireguard-linux-compat script on 
Slackbuilds to build the associated kernel module package.

openresolv is an optional runtime dependency -- you need it if you want
to use to use wg-quick's DNS option.
