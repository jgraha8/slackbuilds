Basilisk browser demonstration program for the Unified XUL Platform.

The Unified XUL Platform (UXP) -- Codename MÃ¶bius, is a hard fork from the
Mozilla code repository (mozilla-central) with an early 2017 fork point.

This builds Basilisk from source and conflicts with the binary repackage also
found on SBo.
