openssh (Secure Shell daemon and clients - with PAM)

ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine and
for executing commands on a remote machine.  It is intended to replace
rlogin and rsh, and provide secure encrypted communications between
two untrusted hosts over an insecure network.
