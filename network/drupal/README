Drupal is content management software. It's used to make many of the
websites and applications you use every day. Drupal has great standard
features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and
excellent security. But what sets it apart is its flexibility;
modularity is one of its core principles. Its tools help you build the
versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need.
