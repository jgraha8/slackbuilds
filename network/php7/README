PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. It shares syntax
characteristics with C, Java, and Perl. The primary objective behind
this language is to make a fast and easy-to-use scripting language for
dynamic web sites.

To enable Kerberus 5 support provide KRB5=yes to the Slackbuild as

    KRB5=yes ./php7.SlackBuild     (requires krb5)


NOTE: This package conflicts with the slackware php package. You must
remove php before installing this package.
