ownCloud gives you universal access to your files through a web interface
or WebDAV. It also provides a platform to easily view & sync your contacts,
calendars and bookmarks across all your devices and enables basic editing
right on the web.

Optional packages
-------------------
* php-pgsql for PostgreSQL support
* php-imagick for creating and modifying images and preview thumbnails
* php-apcu, php-memcached, or php-redis for server performance (caching)
* ffmpeg for preview generation
* libreoffice for preview generation

SlackBuild defaults
-------------------

This SlackBuild uses the following defaults:
* DOCROOT=/srv/httpd/htdocs
* OCNAME=owncloud
* PHPUSER=root
* PHPGROUP=apache

You can change the defaults at build time:
# DOCROOT=/your/preferred/directory \
  OCNAME=owncloud.example.com \
  PHPUSER=youruser \
  PHPGROUP=yourgroup \
  ./owncloud-server.SlackBuild


Configuration
-------------

(1) Add the following in /etc/httpd/httpd.conf

  <Directory "/srv/httpd/htdocs/owncloud">
      Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
      AllowOverride All
      Require all granted
  </Directory>

(2) In /etc/httpd/httpd.conf, enable mod_rewrite and PHP by uncommenting
"LoadModule rewrite_module ..." and "Include /etc/httpd/mod_php.conf",
then restart httpd.

(3) After installation, you must set up the names that clients will use to
access the server as "trusted domains".

You must also do this if you are upgrading an older owncloud installation.

To do this, you will need to edit /srv/httpd/htdocs/owncloud/config/config.php
as follows (please use your own server name instead of myserver.local or
owncloud.example.com):

    'trusted_domains' =>
    array (
      0 => 'localhost',
      1 => 'myserver.local',
      2 => 'owncloud.example.com',
    ),

(4) After installation, **and after every upgrade**, you need to complete
setup by visiting this page:

  http://localhost/owncloud/
