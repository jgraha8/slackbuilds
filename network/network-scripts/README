network-scripts (Scripts to configure a network)

These are the basic scripts and files used to define a network and
configure network interfaces on Linux.  Most of the original
/etc files were written by Fred N. van Kempen, or borrowed from BSD.
The rc.inet1 and rc.inet2 scripts were mostly written by Patrick
Volkerding, with suggestions and fixes from hundreds of contributors
over the years.

NOTE: this package provides support for name-based bridged and bonded
interfaces and replaces the network-scripts package in Slackware.
