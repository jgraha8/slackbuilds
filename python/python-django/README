python-django (The Web framework for perfectionists with deadlines)

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development
and clean, pragmatic design.

To enable python3 installation instead of the default python2
installation, pass PYTHON3=yes to the SlackBuild script as:

  PYTHON3=yes ./python-django.SlackBuild

This build option requires python3.
