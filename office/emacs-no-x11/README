Emacs is the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
display editor. If this seems to be a bit of a mouthful, an
easier explanation is that Emacs is a text editor and more. At
its core is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of the Lisp
programming language with extensions to support text editing.

Be sure to uninstall emacs and either blacklist or greylist it.
