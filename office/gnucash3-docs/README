This is the documentation package for Gnucash3.

This builds the internal help and user guides for Gnucash3.

For the HTML help and user guides to read outside the Gnucash3
application, pass HTML="yes" to the script.

For a specific language, pass DOCLANG="xx", where xx is:
C for English (default)
de for German
it for Italian
pt for Portugese
ja for Japanese (guide only, no help - defaults to C)
ru for Russian (guide only, no help - defaults to C)

Note: This script builds the internal guides in all available
languages, but the HTML guides are only in the spacified language
to save space and avoid any excessive package bloat.
