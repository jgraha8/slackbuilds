minikube

Local Kubernetes, focused on application development & education

As of today bare-metal runs are only supported on systemd enabled systems.
You will need either docker (experimental) or virtualbox to run minikube VMs.

Depending on the driver of choice run it as either:

  minikube start --vm-driver=docker

or

  minikube start --vm-driver=virtualbox

as a non-root user.

kubectl is required to administer your cluster but is not required for the installation.
