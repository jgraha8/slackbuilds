MIT/GNU Scheme is an implementation of the Scheme programming language,
providing an interpreter, compiler, source-code debugger, integrated
Emacs-like editor, and a large runtime library. MIT/GNU Scheme is best suited
to programming large applications with a rapid development cycle.

The purpose of mit-scheme-plugins is to provide the additional MIT/GNU
Scheme blowfish, gdbm, mcrypt, and pgsql plugins. Since version 9.2
these plugins are configured, built, and installed separately from the
main installation.

The following build options are available:

  BLOWFISH=yes|no     Enable support for Blowfish encryption (default: yes)
  GDBM=yes|no         Enable support for gdbm (default: yes)
  PGSQL=yes|no        Enable support for PostgreSQL (default: no), requires postgresql
  MCRYPT=yes|no       Enable support for mcrypt (default: no),  requires mcrypt
  DOCS=yes|no         Include html and pdf documentation (default: no),  requires texlive
  
where each build option may be passed to the slackbuild. Example of
disabling Blowfish and enabling PostgresSQL support:

  BLOWFISH=no PGSQL=yes sh ./mit-scheme-plugins.SlackBuild
