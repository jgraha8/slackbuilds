docopt helps you:
- define the interface for your command-line app, and
- automatically generate a parser for it.
docopt is based on conventions that have been used for decades in help
messages and man pages for describing a program's interface.
An interface description in docopt is such a help message,
but formalized.

python3 is an optional (autodetected) dependency.
