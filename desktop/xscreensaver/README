XScreenSaver (a collection of free screen savers for X11 - with PAM)

XScreenSaver is the standard screen saver collection shipped on most
Linux and Unix systems running the X11 Window System. The first
version was released in 1992.

On X11 systems, XScreenSaver is two things: it is both a large
collection of screen savers; and it is also the framework for blanking
and locking the screen.
