Clockchimes creates a cron job that runs a sox based bash script.
The script plays clock chime sound files based on the system time.
The initial release plays Westminster chimes on the 15 minute,
30 minute, 45 minute and top of the hour.

The installation script modifies /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root file
or creates the /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root file if it doesn't exist. If
the user uninstalls clockchimes then the user should manually remove
the root crontab entry.
