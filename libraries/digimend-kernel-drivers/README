DIGImend graphics tablet drivers for the Linux kernel 

This package offers better hardware support than the drivers provided
in the Linux kernel, such as pencil's pressure sensitivity and tablet's
button mapping.

List of supported tablets can be seen at
https://digimend.github.io/drivers/digimend/tablets/

NOTE:
This will overwrite some existing kernel modules in Slackware kernel
- hid-kye.ko
- hid-uclogic.ko
- hid-polostar.ko (Linux kernel 5.4.x+)
- hid-viewsonic.ko (Linux kernel 5.4.x+)

You must rebuilt this package if you upgrade your kernel.
You can simply remove this package and reinstall kernel-modules to
switch back to original kernel modules.

This driver is tested on Huion Inspiroy H430P
