SimGear is a set of open-source libraries designed to be used as building
blocks for quickly assembling 3d simulations, games, and visualization
applications.

For those wanting to build this in current (15.0 EXPERIMENTAL), pass
CURRENT=yes to the script (currently broken ATM because of the new boost
version but I'm working on it).
